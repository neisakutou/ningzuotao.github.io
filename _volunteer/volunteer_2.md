'English Salon', as a typical elderly service, was established in 2006. 
It takes place every Sunday morning at the Special Population Service Center. 
The purpose of the activity is to provide a platform for elderly English enthusiasts to practice spoken English and engage in mutual communication.

In 2023, the English Salon returns to offline services for the very first time.
This competition is divided into two groups, A and B, with two separate examination rooms. 
Group A involves a written test, while Group B involves an oral examination. 
Elderly participants can choose their competition group based on their individual learning preferences.
