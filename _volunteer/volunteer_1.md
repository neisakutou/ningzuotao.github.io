On December 2, 2023, the Liaoning Provincial Library held a special event titled ‘[Companion with Love, Volunteer Together](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/LgkS9reFn8bq5pzP5bwIkw)’ for the International Day of Persons with Disabilities and International Volunteer Day. I was fortunate to participate in this event and, along with other volunteers, reminisce about the moments from the volunteering activities throughout 2023.
